# Linear-Regression-Analysis-Using-SparkML

This task aims to create a workflow or a series of steps to perform linear regression using Apache Spark's MLlib library. This involves Creating a Spark session, loading the data and pre-processing it (such as feature engineering and transformation), Creating a feature vector, splitting it into training and testing sets, training a linear regression model, evaluating the model's performance, and potentially deploying it for making predictions.
To perform this operation using Apache Spark, a non- trivial research dataset - Restaurants Revenue Prediction dataset was obtained from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/restaurants-revenue-prediction/data) which proves valuable for running this operation due to its size, complexity, variety, validity and real-world relevance.
The dataset includes features crucial for understanding restaurant performance and revenue generation. These features encompass a range of factors such as menu pricing, marketing expenditure, customer engagement, and operational dynamics.
The dataset consists of **1000 instances** and **8 features**, and there were no missing values present in the dataset.  All features are numerical, except for cuisine type, which is nominal
The **Cuisine Type** feature, being categorical, was converted into a numerical vector using Spark MLlib's String Indexer. This transformation is essential for regression analysis because most machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs. 

### Features:
- Number of Customers: The total count of customers served within a month.
- Menu Price: The pricing structure of the items offered on the restaurant's menu.
- Marketing Spend: The amount allocated towards marketing and promotional activities.
- Cuisine Type: The style or category of cuisine offered by the restaurant.
- Average Customer Spending: The mean expenditure of each customer during their visit.
- Promotions: Any promotional activities or discounts offered by the restaurant.
- Reviews: Feedback or reviews provided by customers.
- Monthly Revenue: The target variable representing the total revenue generated by the restaurant in a month.
